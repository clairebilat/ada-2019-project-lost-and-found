# Where to eat in Chigago : an analysis of the inspections from Chicago department of Public Health's Food Protection Programm

# Abstract
The Chicago department of Public Health’s Food Protection Program provides a database which contains information from inspections reports of restaurants and other food establishments in Chicago from 20120 to the present. It contains many information about the establishments, like the type of facility (groceries’ stores, restaurants, coffee shop, …), and its location. Many information about the violations detected there are also provided there, like the reason that led to the inspection.

In our project we endeavor to visualize the healthiness of public food establishments according to the type of facility or its ward. An analysis of the violation’s type according to the facility’s type and the facility’s ward will also be conducted. 

The purpose of the project is to help the consumer to easily choose where to eat in Chicago, but also help the Chicago department of Public Health’s Food Protection Program to adapt their response and work (for example, where should a prevention program be proposed).



# Research questions
How to exercise the appropriate precautions when viewing or analyzing these data in order to manage the duplicatas ?

How to implement a good vizualisation tool (with an interactive map for example) ?

How to take into account that an esthablishment has multiple violations ?

How to manage the fact that the violations' definitions has changed in 2018 ?


# Dataset

The dataset that will be used is the Chicago Food Inspection from the list provided. Specific precautions will have to be taken so that the duplicatas are well managed. As the violations' definition has changed in 2018, we will have to consider a way to manage that. It has been specified that two datasets exist, one for the datas before 2018 and one for the datas after; either we will focus our attention on one of the two or we will have to find a way to merge them. 

# A list of internal milestones up until project milestone 2
- clean the dataset : manage the duplicatas
- take a look at it in order to have an idea of the distribution of the datas :
    - which are the most represented establishments ? Which ones will we study ?
    - what are the most common violations ?
    - how will we implement the healthiness of an establishment ? Only the risk factor or will we take the type of violation into             account ? If so, how to classify them ?
    - Are the locations well distributed or is a ward-study irrelevant ?
