# Abstract
A 150 word description of the project idea, goals, dataset used. What story you would like to tell and why? What's the motivation behind your project?
ex : The US Patent & Trademark Office, short USPTO, offers a full-fledged directed graph of US patent citations since 1975. Many at the time obscure patents paved the way for groundbreaking new technologies in the future, as for example Google's Page Rank (#6285999) or Apple's touch screen devices (#7479949). In our project we endeavor to visualize this massive graph with more than 89 Million edges in an appealing and concise way in order to render the narration of more intricate stories possible and offer potential users a slick and interactive interface for navigating the patents graph. Inspirations on how to beautifully draw a graph network are taken from Kirell Benzi. Those stories may range from analysing node connectivities to extract influences of particular inventors to finding the shortest walks between patents. Through this we hope to gain deeper insight into the metastructure of inventions throughout the digital revolution and how they shape the future as we know it today.


# Research questions
A list of research questions you would like to address during the project. 
ex : How to apply common graph algorithms to a massive data set?
How to efficiently travers and query a graph of that scale?
How to visualize a large and complicated graph?
How to handle missing edges in the patent graph?
How to draw conclusions about technology soley given patents and their citations?


# Dataset
List the dataset(s) you want to use, and some ideas on how do you expect to get, manage, process and enrich it/them. Show us you've read the docs and some examples, and you've a clear idea on what to expect. Discuss data size and format if relevant.
